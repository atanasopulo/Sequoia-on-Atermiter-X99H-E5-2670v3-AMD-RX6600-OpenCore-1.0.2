## I made publicly available my configuration, so people struggling like I was can at least get closer to a solution.

### Check this post on Reddit, for which I made this repository:

### The hardwae this is made for:

- CPU: Xeon E5-2670 v3 | 12 cores 24 threads | 2.3GHz turbo 3.1GHz.
- Motherboard: Atermiter X99H.
- GPU: Sapphire PULSE | AMD RX6600 8GB.
- RAM: 64GB 2133 MHz ECC DDR4 (4x16GB).
- Ethernet Card: Realtek RTL8111.
- Internal Audio: ALC897.
- NVME: ADATA XPG Spectrix S20G 1Tb




You can test if want. But, please, take into consideration that if your CPU, motherboard, or GPU, are different, then it might not work if you don't make the needed changes.
The SMBIOS info like serials, UUID, etc are safe. But please change them as someone else might be using them already.
